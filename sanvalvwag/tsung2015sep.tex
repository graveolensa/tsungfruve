%%% Abstract
\begin{abstract}
How does it drift off into the ethereal..?
slowly sublimating and condensing fronds 
waving to and fro in the starlight, or like steppes of whiffs of fragrant incense, or as the leaves of a tree in the wind with sun gleam sussurating: late summer afternoons impress differently than thunderstorm tree leaf-wildings, or like the sun glitter on bodies of water, or starwatching, or the wispy aroma of reedy tea: minutiae of other whys diffract and rarefact through these experiences, toting translinguistic metanarratives in bucket brigades, blazing pastel intaglios riven, sieved, and sifted, overflows our conceptual cubbyholes and the alluvial deltas of an othering otherness which is more truly home, heart and hearth, if you will, than boxes tied with string, all-concepts tied with string and sold in beguiling packaging at the bazaar. Echo rung and river shadows, let your perception trail off into the imperceptible, and bring back magic.

%%% Bibliography

%%% Actually, I'm of the opinion that a nonmodular bibliography is harmful
%%% Hunting for references is an extremely laborious affair. What is "Comp. Rez. 109(3)? anyway"? And
%%% Why isn't the author including a hyperlink? 
%%% And really the metric here is not "oh, I'm defending what I'm saying", but "how fast can the reader find the supporting"
%%% argument to the contention. Having Xanadu would be nice here. Because saying In [Mc 130], Argyllio Argyre argued that the
%%% Phlebotinum Unobtanium Cohomology group S4(1,a) is nonisogenous to the principally polarized abelian variety which is the
%%% hypersheaf subquotient of the moduli stack and the first fundamental group of the Ven Nerstraond epigerbe. Sometimes those
%%% numbers and letters get in the way of the argument. So, drop 'em
